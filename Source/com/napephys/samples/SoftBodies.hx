/**
 * Sample: Soft Bodies
 * Author: Luca Deltodesco
 *
 * Nape does not support Soft Bodies natively, however there
 * are many ways of creating soft bodies regardless. This sample
 * demonstrates a succesful (if expensive) approach that has many
 * nice properties, stable stacking of bodies with inter-collisions
 * and even self-collisions of a soft body.
 *
 * We achieve this by using polygonal segments discretising the
 * perimeter of the body which are connected on the outside via
 * stiff PivotJoints, and on the inside by elastic PivotJoints.
 *
 * Additionally to help with making bodies more rigid, a gas
 * pressure force is computed per-body and applied to each segment
 * outwards.
 *
 * Even though this is an expensive method with LOTS of Bodies
 * and Constraints, it is still highly performant!
